/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Spare change?");
console.log("Hello World");//does not work without parentheses
console.log('Wassup');//Quotations need to be there but single and double parentheses seem to work the same
console.log('Ello')//the code seems to still work without a semicolin
console.log(3+5);
console.log("what's funnier than 24?"); console.log("2"+"5"); 
console.log("what" +" is"+" up");
console.log('The raven "Nevermore"');
console.log("What's two plus two?"); console.log("4");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
